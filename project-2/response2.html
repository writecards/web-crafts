      The cyberfeminist manifesto “articulates feminism on the internet as
      visceral—related to *viscera,* slime, wetware, and birth. It still feels
      that way: messy, howling, but very much alive.” this reminds me of glitch
      feminism. Notably, the glitch is ephemeral and exists only in the present.
      I like to think of this akin encouraging marginalized identities to be
      unashamed to take up space in a cis-het-patriarchal society. VNS matrix
      produced the cyberfeminist manifesto in 1992, which feels way ahead of its
      time. It is a spectacular creation that I’m glad was produced. Glitch
      studies manifesto reminded me of the world’s first glitch-art video,
      titled digital tv dinner. It was created by Jamie Faye Fenton, a trans
      woman who played a significant role in early days of adobe. The video was
      made by her smashing video game cartridges repeatedly while removing them
      from the console - a supercut of hundreds of hours of her labor. watch it
