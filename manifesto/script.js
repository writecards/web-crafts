let str = "This essay is an effort to build an ironic political myth faithful to feminism, socialism, and materialism. \\ Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification. \\ Blasphemy has always seemed to require taking things very seriously. \\I know no better stance to adopt from within the secular-religious, evangelical traditions of United States poli- tics, including the politics of socialist-feminism. \\ Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still insist- ing on the need for community.\\ Blasphemy is not apostasy. \\Irony is about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension of holding incom- patible things together because both or all are necessary and true. \\Irony is about humor and serious play. \\It is also a rhetorical strategy and a political method, one I would like to see more honored within socialist-feminism. \\At the center of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg. \\A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction.\\ Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world-changing fiction.\\ The international women’s movements have constructed “women’s experience,” as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object. \\This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. \\Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. \\The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women’s experience in the late twentieth century. \\ Thisisastruggleoverlifeand death, but the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion. \\ Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs—creatures simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted.\\ Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings between organism and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a power that were not generated in the history of sexuality.\\ Cyborg “sex” restores some of the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic prophylactics against hetero- sexism). \\ Cyborg replication is uncoupled from organic reproduction. \\ Modem production seems like a dream of cyborg colonization work, a dream that makes the nightmare of Taylorism seem idyllic. \\ And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C3I, command-control-communication-intelligence, an $84 billion item in 1984’s U.S. defense budget.\\  I am making an argument for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings. \\Michel Foucault’s biopolitics is a flaccid premonition of cyborg politics, a very open field.\\ By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism—in short, cyborgs. \\The cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. \\The cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined centers structuring any possibility of historical transformation. \\In the traditions of “Western” science and politics—the tradition of racist, male-dominant capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tradition of the appropriation of nature as resource for the productions of culture; the tradition of reproduction of the self from the reflections of the other—the relation between organism and machine has been a border war. \\ The stakes in the border war have been the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination.\\ This essay is an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for responsibility in their construction.\\ It is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist culture and theory in a postmodernist, non-naturalist mode and in the utopian tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end.\\ The cyborg incarnation is outside salvation history.\\ Nor does it mark time on an oedipal calendar, attempting to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse.\\ As Zoë Sofoulis argues in her unpublished manuscript on Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, and nuclear culture, “Lacklein,” the most terrible and perhaps the most promising monsters in cyborg worlds are embodied in non-oedipal narratives with a different logic of repression, which we need to understand for our survival. \\ The cyborg is a creature in a postgender world; it has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all the powers of the parts into a higher unity.\\ In a sense, the cyborg has no origin story in the Western sense—a “final” irony since the cyborg is also the awful apocalyptic telos of the “West’s” escalating dominations of abstract individuation, an ultimate self untied at last from all dependency, a man in space.  \\An origin story in the “Western,” humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity, fullness, bliss and terror, represented by the phallic mother from whom all humans must separate, the task of individual development and of history, the twin potent myths inscribed most powerfully for us in psychoanalysis and Marxism. Hilary Klein has argued that both Marxism and psychoanalysis, in their concepts of labor and of individuation and gender formation, depend on the plot of original unity out of which difference must be produced and enlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature.\\ The cyborg skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the Western sense. \\ This is its illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of its teleology as Star Wars. \\ The cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, inti- macy, and perversity. \\ It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence.\\ No longer structured by the polarity of public and private, the cyborg defines a technological polis based partly on a revolution of social relations in the oikos, the household. \\Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other. \\The relationships for forming wholes from parts, including those of polarity and hierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg world.\\ Unlike the hopes of Frankenstein’s monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to save it through a restoration of the garden—that is, through the fabrication of a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a finshed whole, a city and cosmos. The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time with- out the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of re- turning to dust. Perhaps that is why I want to see if cyborgs can subvert the apocalypse of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the Enemy. Cyborgs are not rever- ent; they do not re-member the cosmos. They are wary of hol - ism, but needy for connection—they seem to have a natural feel for united-front politics, but without the vanguard party. The main trouble with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the ille- gitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential. I will return to the science fiction of cyborgs at the end of this essay, but now I want to signal three crucial boundary break- downs that make the following political-fictional (political- scientific) analysis possible. By the late twentieth century in U.S. scientific culture, the boundary between human and ani- mal is thoroughly breached. The last beachheads of uniqueness have been polluted if not turned into amusement parks: lan- guage, tool use, social behavior, mental events—nothing really convincingly settles the separation of human and animal. And many people no longer feel the need for such a separation; in- deed, many branches of feminist culture affirm the pleasure of connection of human and other living creatures. Movements for animal rights are not irrational denials of human unique- ness; they are a clear-sighted recognition of connection across the discredited breach of nature and culture. Biology and evo- lutionary theory over the past two centuries have simultane- ously produced modern organisms as objects of knowledge and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace re-etched in ideological struggle or professional disputes be- tween life and social science. Within this framework, teaching modern Christian creationism should be fought as a form of child abuse. Biological-determinist ideology is only one position opened up in scientific culture for arguing the meanings of human animality. There is much room for radical political people to con- test the meanings of the breached boundary.3 The cyborg ap- pears in myth precisely where the boundary between human and animal is transgressed. Far from signaling a walling off of people from other living beings, cyborgs signal disturbingly and pleasurably tight coupling. Bestiality has a new status in this cycle of marriage exchange. The second leaky distinction is between animal–human (organism) and machine. Pre-cybernetic machines could be haunted; there was always the specter of the ghost in the ma- chine. This dualism structured the dialogue between material- ism and idealism that was settled by a dialectical progeny, called spirit or history, according to taste. But basically machines were not self-moving, self-designing, autonomous. They could not achieve man’s dream, only mock it. They were not man, an au- thor to himself, but only a caricature of that masculinist repro- ductive dream. To think they were otherwise was paranoid. Now we are not so sure. Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to or- ganisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert."
