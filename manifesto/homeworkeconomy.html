        >The “New Industrial Revolution” is producing a new worldwide working
        class, as well as new sexualities and ethnicities.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        The extreme mobility of capital and the emerging international di-
        vision of labor are intertwined with the emergence of new col-
        lectivities, and the weakening of familiar groupings.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        These developments are neither gender- nor race-neutral.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        White men in advanced industrial societies have become newly vulnerable
        to permanent job loss, and women are not disappearing from the job rolls
        at the same rates as men.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        It is not simply that women in Third World countries are the preferred
        labor force for the sci- ence-based multinationals in the
        export-processing sectors, particularly in electronics.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        The picture is more systematic and involves reproduction, sexuality,
        culture, consumption, and production.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        In the prototypical Silicon Valley, many women’s lives have been
        structured around employment in electronics- dependent jobs, and their
        intimate realities include serial het- erosexual monogamy, negotiating
        childcare, distance from ex- tended kin or most other forms of
        traditional community, a high likelihood of loneliness and extreme
        economic vulnerability as they age.
      </span>
      <span class="blurry-r"
        >The ethnic and racial diversity of women in Silicon Valley structures a
        microcosm of conflicting differences in cul- ture, family, religion,
        education, and language.
      </span>
      <span class="blurry"
        >Richard Gordon has called this new situation the “homework
        economy.”20</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r"
        >Although he includes the phenomenon of literal homework emerging in
        connection with electronics assembly, Gordon intends homework economy to
        name a restructuring of work that broadly has the characteristics
        formerly ascribed to female jobs, jobs literally done only by women.
      </span>
      <span class="blurry">
        Work is being re- defined as both literally female and feminized,
        whether per- formed by men or women.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        To be feminized means to be made extremely vulnerable; able to be
        disassembled, reassembled, exploited as a reserve labor force; seen less
        as workers than as servers; subjected to time arrangements on and off
        the paid job that make a mockery of a limited workday; leading an
        existence that always borders on being obscene, out of place, and
        reducible to sex.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry"
        >Deskilling is an old strategy newly applicable to formerly privileged
        workers. However, the homework econ- omy does not refer only to
        large-scale deskilling, nor does it deny that new areas of high skill
        are emerging, even for women and men previously excluded from skilled
        employment.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        Rather, the concept indicates that factory, home, and market are inte-
        grated on a new scale and that the places of women are crucial— and need
        to be analyzed for differences among women and for meanings for
        relations between men and women in various sit- uations.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry"
        >The homework economy as a world capitalist organizational structure is
        made possible by (not caused by) the new technologies.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        The success of the attack on relatively privileged, mostly white, men’s
        unionized jobs is tied to the power of the new com- munications
        technologies to integrate and control labor despite extensive dispersion
        and decentralization.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry"
        >The consequences of the new technologies are felt by women both in the
        loss of the family (male) wage (if they ever had access to this white
        privi- lege) and in the character of their own jobs, which are becoming
        capital-intensive—for example, office work and nursing.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r"
        >The new economic and technological arrangements are also related to the
        collapsing welfare state and the ensuing intensifi- cation of demands on
        women to sustain daily life for themselves as well as for men, children,
        and old people.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        The feminization of poverty—generated by dismantling the welfare state,
        by the homework economy where stable jobs become the exception, and
        sustained by the expectation that women’s wages will not be matched by a
        male income for the support of children—has become an urgent
        focus.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        The causes of various women-headed households are a function of race,
        class, or sexuality; but their increasing generality is a ground for
        coalitions of women on many issues.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        That women regularly sustain daily life partly as a function of their
        enforced status as mothers is hardly new; the kind of integration with
        the overall capitalist and progressively war-based economy is new.
      </span>
      <span class="blurry">
        The particular pressure, for example, on U.S. black women, who have
        achieved an escape from (barely) paid domestic service and who now hold
        clerical and similar jobs in large numbers, has large implications for
        contin- ued enforced black poverty with employment.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        Teenage women in industrializing areas of the Third World increasingly
        find themselves the sole or major source of a cash wage for their
        families, while access to land is ever more problematic.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        These developments must have major consequences in the psychody- namics
        and politics of gender and race.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r"
        >Within the framework of three major stages of capitalism
        (commercial/early industrial, monopoly, multinational)—tied to
        nationalism, imperialism, and multinationalism, and related to Jameson’s
        three dominant aesthetic periods of realism, mod- ernism, and
        postmodernism—I would argue that specific forms of families
        dialectically relate to forms of capital and to its political and
        cultural concomitants.
      </span>
      <span class="blurry">
        Although lived problemat- ically and unequally, ideal forms of these
        families might be schematized as (1) the patriarchal nuclear family,
        structured by the dichotomy between public and private and accompanied
        by the white bourgeois ideology of separate spheres and nine-
        teenth-century Anglo-American bourgeois feminism;
      </span>
      <span class="blurry-r">
        (2) the modern family mediated (or enforced) by the welfare state and
        institutions like the family wage, with a flowering of a-feminist
        heterosexual ideologies, including their radical versions repre- sented
        in Greenwich Village around the First World War;</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        and (3) the “family” of the homework economy with its oxymoronic
        structure of women-headed households and its explosion of feminisms and
        the paradoxical intensification and erosion of gender itself.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        This is the context in which the projections for worldwide structural
        unemployment stemming from the new technologies are part of the picture
        of the homework economy.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        As robotics and related technologies put men out of work in “developed”
        countries and exacerbate failure to generate male jobs in Third World
        “development,” and as the automated office becomes the rule even in
        labor-surplus countries, the feminization of work intensifies.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        Black women in the United States have long known what it looks like to
        face the structural underemployment (“feminization”) of black men, as
        well as their own highly vul- nerable position in the wage economy. It
        is no longer a secret that sexuality, reproduction, family, and
        community life are in- terwoven with this economic structure in myriad
        ways that have also differentiated the situations of white and black
        women.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        Many more women and men will contend with similar situations, which will
        make cross-gender and race alliances on issues of basic life support
        (with or without jobs) necessary, not just nice.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        The new technologies also have a profound effect on hunger and on food
        production for subsistence worldwide.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        Rae Lessor Blumberg (1981) estimates that women produce about 50 per-
        cent of the world’s subsistence food.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r"
        >21 Women are excluded generally from benefiting from the increased
        high-tech com- modification of food and energy crops, their days are
        made more arduous because their responsibilities to provide food do not
        diminish, and their reproductive situations are made more complex.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        Green Revolution technologies interact with other high-tech industrial
        production to alter gender divisions of la- bor and differential gender
        migration patterns.
      </span>
      <span class="blurry-r"
        >The new technologies seem deeply involved in the forms of
        “privatization” that Rosalind Petchesky (1981) has analyzed, in which
        militarization, right-wing family ideologies and policies, and
        intensified definitions of corporate (and state) property as private
        synergistically interact.22
      </span>
      <span class="blurry-r">
        The new communications technologies are fundamental to the eradication
        of “public life” for everyone.
      </span>
      <span class="blurry"
        >This facilitates the mushrooming of a permanent high-tech military
        establishment at the cultural and economic expense of most people, but
        especially of women.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        Technologies like video games and highly miniaturized televisions seem
        cru- cial to production of modern forms of “private life.”</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        The culture of video games is heavily oriented to individual competition
        and extraterrestrial warfare.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry"
        >High-tech, gendered imaginations are produced here, imaginations that
        can contemplate destruc- tion of the planet and a sci-fi escape from its
        consequences.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        More than our imaginations is militarized; and the other reali- ties of
        electronic and nuclear warfare are inescapable.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r"
        >These are the technologies that promise ultimate mobility and perfect
        ex- change—and incidentally enable tourism, that perfect practice of
        mobility and exchange, to emerge as one of the world’s largest single
        industries.
      </span>
      <span class="blurry">
        The new technologies affect the social relations of both sex- uality and
        of reproduction, and not always in the same ways. The close ties of
        sexuality and instrumentality, of views of the body as a kind of private
        satisfaction- and utility-maximizing machine, are described nicely in
        sociobiological origin stories that stress a genetic calculus and
        explain the inevitable dialectic of domination of male and female gender
        roles.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        23 These so - ciobiological stories depend on a high-tech view of the
        body as a biotic component or cybernetic communications system.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r">
        Among the many transformations of reproductive situations is the medical
        one, where women’s bodies have boundaries newly permeable to both
        “visualization” and “intervention.”</span
      >
      <span class="blurry">
        Of course, who controls the interpretation of bodily boundaries in
        medical hermeneutics is a major feminist issue.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry"
        >The specu- lum served as an icon of women’s claiming their bodies in
        the 1970s; that handcraft tool is inadequate to express our needed body
        politics in the negotiation of reality in the practices of cy- borg
        reproduction.</span
      >
      <span class="blurry-r"> Self-help is not enough.</span>
      <span class="blurry-r"
        >The technologies of visualization recall the important cultural
        practice of hunting with the camera and the deeply predatory nature of a
        photo- graphic consciousness.</span

        24 Sex, sexuality, and reproduction are central actors in high-tech myth

      <span class="blurry-r"
        >Another critical aspect of the social relations of the new technologies

        A major social and political danger is the forma- tion of a strongly

        illiteracy of several varieties, and general redundancy and impotence,
