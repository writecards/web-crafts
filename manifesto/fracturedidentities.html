          It has become difficult to name one’s feminism by a single ad-
          jective—or even to insist in every circumstance on the noun.
          Consciousness of exclusion through naming is acute. Identities seem
          contradictory, partial, and strategic. With the hard-won recognition
          of their social and historical constitution, gender, race, and class
          cannot provide the basis for belief in “essential” unity. There is
          nothing about being “female” that naturally binds women. There is not
          even such a state as “being” female, itself a highly complex category
          constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social
          practices. Gender, race, or class consciousness is an achievement
          forced on us by the terrible historical experience of the
          contradictory social realities of patriarchy, colonialism, and
          capitalism. And who counts as “us” in my own rhetoric? Which
          identities are available to ground such a potent political myth called
          “us,” and what could motivate enlistment in this collectivity? Painful
          frag - mentation among feminists (not to mention among women) along
          every possible fault line has made the concept of woman elusive, an
          excuse for the matrix of women’s dominations of each other. For me—and
          for many who share a similar historical location in white,
          professional middle-class, female, radical, North American, mid-adult
          bodies—the sources of a crisis in political identity are legion. The
          recent history for much of the U.S. left and U.S. feminism has been a
          response to this kind of crisis by endless splitting and searches for
          a new essential unity. But there has also been a growing recognition
          of another re- sponse through coalition—affinity, not identity.

          Chela Sandoval (n.d.; 1984), from a consideration of specific
          historical moments in the formation of the new political voice called
          women of color, has theorized a hopeful model of political identity
          called “oppositional consciousness,” born of the skills for reading
          webs of power by those refused stable membership in the social
          categories of race, sex, or class. Women of color, a name contested at
          its origins by those whom it would incorpo- rate, as well as a
          historical consciousness marking systematic breakdown of all the signs
          of Man in “Western” traditions, con- structs a kind of postmodernist
          identity out of otherness, dif- ference, and specificity. This
          postmodernist identity is fully political, whatever might be said
          about other possible postmodernisms. Sandoval’s oppositional
          consciousness is about con- tradictory locations and heterochronic
          calendars, not about relativisms and pluralisms. Sandoval emphasizes
          the lack of any essential criterion for identifying who is a woman of
          color. She notes that the defini- tion of the group has been by
          conscious appropriation of nega- tion. For example, a Chicana or U.S.
          black woman has not been able to speak as a woman or as a black person
          or as a Chicano. Thus, she was at the bottom of a cascade of negative
          identi- ties, left out of even the privileged oppressed authorial
          cate- gories called “women and blacks,” who claimed to make the
          important revolutions. The category “woman” negated all non- white
          women; “black” negated all nonblack people, as well as all black
          women. But there was also no “she,” no singularity, but a sea of
          differences among U.S. women who have affirmed their historical
          identity as U.S. women of color. This identity marks out a
          self-consciously constructed space that cannot affirm the capacity to
          act on the basis of natural identification, but only on the basis of
          conscious coalition, of affinity, of political kinship.11 Unlike the
          “woman” of some streams of the white women’s movement in the United
          States, there is no naturalization of the matrix, or at least this is
          what Sandoval argues is uniquely avail- able through the power of
          oppositional consciousness. Sandoval’s argument has to be seen as one
          potent formu - lation for feminists out of the worldwide development
          of an- ticolonialist discourse; that is to say, discourse dissolving
          the “West” and its highest product—the one who is not animal,
          barbarian, or woman; man, that is, the author of a cosmos called
          history. As orientalism is deconstructed politically and semi-
          otically, the identities of the occident destabilize, including those
          of feminists.12 Sandoval argues that “women of color” have a chance to
          build an effective unity that does not replicate the imperializing,
          totalizing revolutionary subjects of previous Marxisms and feminisms,
          which had not faced the conse- quences of the disorderly polyphony
          emerging from decolo- nization.

          Katie King has emphasized the limits of identification and the
          political/poetic mechanics of identification built into read- ing “the
          poem,” that generative core of cultural feminism. King criticizes the
          persistent tendency among contemporary femi- nists from different
          “moments” or “conversations” in feminist practice to taxonomize the
          women’s movement to make one’s own political tendencies appear to be
          the telos of the whole. These taxonomies tend to remake feminist
          history so that it ap- pears to be an ideological struggle among
          coherent types per- sisting over time, especially those typical units
          called radical, liberal, and socialist-feminism. Literally, all other
          feminisms are either incorporated or marginalized, usually by building
          an explicit ontology and epistemology.13 Taxonomies of femi- nism
          produce epistemologies to police deviation from official women’s
          experience. And of course, “women’s culture,” like women of color, is
          consciously created by mechanisms inducing affinity. The rituals of
          poetry, music, and certain forms of academic practice have been
          preeminent. The politics of race and culture in the U.S. women’s
          movements are intimately in- terwoven. The common achievement of King
          and Sandoval is learning how to craft a poetic/political unity without
          relying on a logic of appropriation, incorporation, and taxonomic
          identi- fication. The theoretical and practical struggle against
          unity- through-domination or unity-through-incorporation ironi- cally
          undermines not only the justifications for patriarchy, colonialism,
          humanism, positivism, essentialism, scientism, and other unlamented
          -isms, but all claims for an organic or natural standpoint. I think
          that radical and socialist/Marxist- feminisms have also undermined
          their/our own epistemo- logical strategies and that this is a
          crucially valuable step in imagining possible unities. It remains to
          be seen whether all “epistemologies” as Western political people have
          known them fail us in the task to build effective affinities. It is
          important to note that the effort to construct revolu- tionary
          standpoints, epistemologies as achievements of people committed to
          changing the world, has been part of the process showing the limits of
          identification. The acid tools of postmod- ernist theory and the
          constructive tools of ontological dis- course about revolutionary
          subjects might be seen as ironic al- lies in dissolving Western selves
          in the interests of survival. We are excruciatingly conscious of what
          it means to have a historically constituted body. But with the loss of
          innocence in our origin, there is no expulsion from the Garden either.
          Our politics lose the indulgence of guilt with the naïveté of
          innocence. But what would another political myth for
          socialist-feminism look like? What kind of politics could embrace
          partial, contradictory, permanently unclosed constructions of personal
          and collective selves and still be faithful, effective—and,
          ironically, socialist- feminist?

          I do not know of any other time in history when there was greater need
          for political unity to confront effectively the dom- inations of
          “race,” “gender,” “sexuality,” and “class.” I also do not know of any
          other time when the kind of unity we might help build could have been
          possible. None of “us” has any longer the symbolic or material
          capability of dictating the shape of reality to any of “them.” Or at
          least “we” cannot claim inno- cence from practicing such dominations.
          White women, in- cluding socialist-feminists, discovered (that is,
          were forced kicking and screaming to notice) the noninnocence of the
          cate- gory “woman.” That consciousness changes the geography of all
          previous categories; it denatures them as heat denatures a fragile
          protein. Cyborg feminists have to argue that “we” do not want any more
          natural matrix of unity and that no construction is whole. Innocence,
          and the corollary insistence on victimhood as the only ground for
          insight, has done enough damage. But the constructed revolutionary
          subject must give late-twentieth- century people pause as well. In the
          fraying of identities and in the reflexive strategies for constructing
          them, the possibility opens up for weaving something other than a
          shroud for the day after the apocalypse that so prophetically ends
          salvation history. Both Marxist/socialist-feminisms and radical
          feminisms have simultaneously naturalized and denatured the category
          “woman” and consciousness of the social lives of “women.” Perhaps a
          schematic caricature can highlight both kinds of moves. Marxian
          socialism is rooted in an analysis of wage labor that reveals class
          structure. The consequence of the wage rela- tionship is systematic
          alienation, as the worker is dissociated from his (sic) product.
          Abstraction and illusion rule in knowl- edge, domination rules in
          practice. Labor is the preeminently privileged category enabling the
          Marxist to overcome illusion and find that point of view that is
          necessary for changing the world. Labor is the humanizing activity
          that makes man; labor is an ontological category permitting the
          knowledge of a sub- ject, and so the knowledge of subjugation and
          alienation. In faithful filiation, socialist-feminism advanced by
          allying itself with the basic analytic strategies of Marxism. The main
          achievement of both Marxist feminists and socialist feminists was to
          expand the category of labor to accommodate what (some) women did,
          even when the wage relation was subordi- nated to a more comprehensive
          view of labor under capitalist patriarchy. In particular, women’s
          labor in the household and women’s activity as mothers generally (that
          is, reproduction in the socialist-feminist sense) entered theory on
          the authority of analogy to the Marxian concept of labor. The unity of
          women here rests on an epistemology based on the ontological struc-
          ture of “labor.” Marxist/socialist-feminism does not “natural- ize”
          unity; it is a possible achievement based on a possible standpoint
          rooted in social relations. The essentializing move is in the
          ontological structure of labor or of its analogue, women’s activity.14
          The inheritance of Marxian humanism, with its pre- eminently Western
          self, is the difficulty for me. The contribu- tion from these
          formulations has been the emphasis on the daily responsibility of real
          women to build unities, rather than to nat- uralize them.

          Catharine MacKinnon’s (1982, 1987) version of radical fem- inism is
          itself a caricature of the appropriating, incorporating, totalizing
          tendencies of Western theories of identity grounding action.15 It is
          factually and politically wrong to assimilate all of the diverse
          “moments” or “conversations” in recent women’s politics named radical
          feminism to MacKinnon’s version. But the teleological logic of her
          theory shows how an epistemology and ontology—including their
          negations—erase or police dif- ference. Only one of the effects of
          MacKinnon’s theory is the rewriting of the history of the polymorphous
          field called radical feminism. The major effect is the production of a
          theory of ex- perience, of women’s identity, that is a kind of
          apocalypse for all revolutionary standpoints. That is, the
          totalization built into this tale of radical feminism achieves its
          end—the unity of women—by enforcing the experience of and testimony to
          radi- cal nonbeing. As for the Marxist/socialist-feminist, conscious-
          ness is an achievement, not a natural fact. And MacKinnon’s theory
          eliminates some of the difficulties built into humanist revolutionary
          subjects, but at the cost of radical reductionism. MacKinnon argues
          that feminism necessarily adopted a dif- ferent analytical strategy
          from Marxism, looking first not at the structure of class but at the
          structure of sex/gender and its generative relationship, men’s
          constitution and appropriation of women sexually. Ironically,
          MacKinnon’s “ontology” con- structs a nonsubject, a nonbeing.
          Another’s desire, not the self’s labor, is the origin of “woman.” She
          therefore develops a theory of consciousness that enforces what can
          count as “women’s” experience—anything that names sexual violation,
          indeed, sex itself as far as “women” can be concerned. Feminist
          practice is the construction of this form of consciousness—that is,
          the self-knowledge of a self-who-is-not. Perversely, sexual
          appropriation in this feminism still has the epistemological status of
          labor; that is to say, the point from which an analysis able to
          contribute to changing the world must flow. But sexual
          objectification, not alienation, is the conse- quence of the structure
          of sex/gender. In the realm of knowl- edge, the result of sexual
          objectification is illusion and ab - straction. However, a woman is
          not simply alienated from her product but in a deep sense does not
          exist as a subject, or even potential subject, since she owes her
          existence as a woman to sexual appropriation. To be constituted by
          another’s desire is not the same thing as to be alienated in the
          violent separation of the laborer from his product.

          MacKinnon’s radical theory of experience is totalizing in the extreme;
          it does not so much marginalize as obliterate the au- thority of any
          other women’s political speech and action. It is a totalization
          producing what Western patriarchy itself never succeeded in
          doing—feminists’ consciousness of the nonexis- tence of women, except
          as products of men’s desire. I think MacKinnon correctly argues that
          no Marxian version of iden- tity can firmly ground women’s unity. But
          in solving the prob- lem of the contradictions of any Western
          revolutionary subject for feminist purposes, she develops an even more
          authoritarian doctrine of experience. If my complaint about
          socialist/Marx- ian standpoints is their unintended erasure of
          polyvocal, unas- similable, radical difference made visible in
          anticolonial dis- course and practice, MacKinnon’s intentional erasure
          of all difference through the device of the “essential” nonexistence
          of women is not reassuring. In my taxonomy, which like any other
          taxonomy is a rein- scription of history, radical feminism can
          accommodate all the activities of women named by socialist-feminists
          as forms of labor only if the activity can somehow be sexualized.
          Repro- duction had different tones of meanings for the two tendencies,
          one rooted in labor, one in sex, both calling the consequences of
          domination and ignorance of social and personal reality “false
          consciousness.” Beyond either the difficulties or the contributions in
          the argument of any one author, neither Marxist nor radical feminist
          points of view have tended to embrace the status of a partial ex-
          planation; both were regularly constituted as totalities. West- ern
          explanation has demanded as much; how else could the “Western” author
          incorporate its others? Each tried to annex other forms of domination
          by expanding its basic categories through analogy, simple listing, or
          addition. Embarrassed si- lence about race among white radical and
          socialist-feminists was one major, devastating political consequence.
          History and polyvocality disappear into political taxonomies that try
          to es- tablish genealogies. There was no structural room for race (or
          for much else) in theory claiming to reveal the construction of the
          category woman and social group women as a unified or to- talizable
          whole. The structure of my caricature looks like this:
          socialist-feminism—structure of class // wage labor // alienation
          labor, by analogy reproduction, by extension sex, by addition race
          radical feminism—structure of gender // sexual appro- priation //
          objectification sex, by analogy labor, by extension reproduction, by
          addition race

          In another context, the French theorist Julia Kristeva claimed that
          women appeared as a historical group after the Second World War, along
          with groups like youth.16 Her dates are doubt- ful; but we are now
          accustomed to remembering that as objects of knowledge and as
          historical actors “race” did not always ex- ist, “class” has a
          historical genesis, and “homosexuals” are quite junior. It is no
          accident that the symbolic system of the family of man—and so the
          essence of woman—breaks up at the same moment that networks of
          connection among people on the planet are unprecedentedly multiple,
          pregnant, and com- plex. “Advanced capitalism” is inadequate to convey
          the struc- ture of this historical moment. In the “Western” sense, the
          end of man is at stake. It is no accident that woman disintegrates
          into women in our time. Perhaps socialist-feminists were not
          substantially guilty of producing essentialist theory that sup-
          pressed women’s particularity and contradictory interests. I think we
          have been, at least through unreflective participation in the logics,
          languages, and practices of white humanism and through searching for a
          single ground of domination to secure our revolutionary voice. Now we
          have less excuse. But in the consciousness of our failures, we risk
          lapsing into boundless difference and giving up on the confusing task
          of making par- tial, real connection. Some differences are playful;
          some are poles of world historical systems of domination. “Epistemol-
          ogy” is about knowing the difference.

          In this attempt at an epistemological and political position, I would
          like to sketch a picture of possible unity, a picture in- debted to
          socialist and feminist principles of design. The frame for my sketch
          is set by the extent and importance of rearrange- ments in worldwide
          social relations tied to science and technol- ogy. I argue for a
          politics rooted in claims about fundamental changes in the nature of
          class, race, and gender in an emerging system of world order analogous
          in its novelty and scope to that created by industrial capitalism; we
          are living through a move- ment from an organic, industrial society to
          a polymorphous, in- formation system—from all work to all play, a
          deadly game. Si- multaneously material and ideological, the
          dichotomies may be expressed in the following chart of transitions
          from the com- fortable old hierarchical dominations to the scary new

          This list suggests several interesting things.17 First, the ob- jects
          on the right-hand side cannot be coded as “natural,” a re- alization
          that subverts naturalistic coding for the left-hand side as well. We
          cannot go back ideologically or materially. It’s not just that “god”
          is dead; so is the “goddess.” Or both are revivi- fied in the worlds
          charged with microelectronic and biotechno- logical politics. In
          relation to objects like biotic components, one must think not in
          terms of essential properties, but in terms of design, boundary
          constraints, rates of flows, systems logics, costs of lowering
          constraints. Sexual reproduction is one kind of reproductive strategy
          among many, with costs and benefits as a function of the system
          environment. Ideologies of sexual reproduction can no longer
          reasonably call on notions of sex and sex role as organic aspects in
          natural objects like organisms and families. Such reasoning will be
          unmasked as irrational, and ironically corporate executives reading
          Playboy and antiporn radical feminists will make strange bedfellows in
          jointly un- masking the irrationalism. Likewise for race, ideologies
          about human diversity have to be formulated in terms of frequencies of
          parameters, like blood groups or intelligence scores. It is
          “irrational” to invoke con- cepts like primitive and civilized. For
          liberals and radicals, the search for integrated social systems gives
          way to a new prac- tice called “experimental ethnography” in which an
          organic ob- ject dissipates in attention to the play of writing. At
          the level of ideology, we see translations of racism and colonialism
          into lan- guages of development and underdevelopment, rates and con-
          straints of modernization. Any objects or persons can be rea- sonably
          thought of in terms of disassembly and reassembly; no “natural”
          architectures constrain system design. The financial districts in all
          the world’s cities, as well as the export-process- ing and free trade
          zones, proclaim this elementary fact of “late capitalism.” The entire
          universe of objects that can be known scientifically must be
          formulated as problems in communica- tions engineering (for the
          managers) or theories of the text (for those who would resist). Both
          are cyborg semiologies. One should expect control strategies to
          concentrate on boundary conditions and interfaces, on rates of flow
          across boundaries—and not on the integrity of natural objects. “In-
          tegrity” or “sincerity” of the Western self gives way to decision
          procedures and expert systems. For example, control strategies applied
          to women’s capacities to give birth to new human beings will be
          developed in the languages of population control and maximization of
          goal achievement for individual decision- makers. Control strategies
          will be formulated in terms of rates, costs of constraints, degrees of
          freedom. Human beings, like any other component or subsystem, must be
          localized in a sys- tem architecture whose basic modes of operation
          are proba- bilistic, statistical. No objects, spaces, or bodies are
          sacred in themselves; any component can be interfaced with any other
          if the proper standard, the proper code, can be constructed for
          processing signals in a common language. Exchange in this world
          transcends the universal translation effected by capitalist markets
          that Marx analyzed so well. The privileged pathology affecting all
          kinds of components in this universe is stress— communications
          breakdown (Hogness 1983). The cyborg is not subject to Foucault’s
          biopolitics; the cyborg simulates politics, a much more potent field
          of operations. This kind of analysis of scientific and cultural
          objects of knowledge that have appeared historically since the Second
          World War prepares us to notice some important inadequacies in
          feminist analysis that has proceeded as if the organic, hierar- chical
          dualisms ordering discourse in “the West” since Aristotle still ruled.
          They have been cannibalized, or as Zoë Sofia (1984) might put it, they
          have been “techno-digested.” The dicho - tomies between mind and body,
          animal and human, organism and machine, public and private, nature and
          culture, men and women, primitive and civilized are all in question
          ideologically. The actual situation of women is their
          integration/exploitation into a world system of
          production/reproduction and communi- cation called the informatics of
          domination. The home, work- place, market, public arena, the body
          itself—all can be dispersed and interfaced in nearly infinite,
          polymorphous ways, with large consequences for women and
          others—consequences that themselves are very different for different
          people and that make potent oppositional international movements
          difficult to imag- ine and essential for survival. One important route
          for recon- structing socialist-feminist politics is through theory and
          prac- tice addressed to the social relations of science and
          technology, including crucially the systems of myth and meanings
          struc- turing our imaginations. The cyborg is a kind of disassembled
          and reassembled, postmodern collective and personal self. This is the
          self feminists must code. Communications technologies and
          biotechnologies are the crucial tools recrafting our bodies. These
          tools embody and en- force new social relations for women worldwide.
          Technologies and scientific discourses can be partially understood as
          formal- izations, i.e., as frozen moments, of the fluid social
          interactions constituting them, but they should also be viewed as
          instru- ments for enforcing meanings. The boundary is permeable be-
          tween tool and myth, instrument and concept, historical sys- tems of
          social relations and historical anatomies of possible bodies,
          including objects of knowledge. Indeed, myth and tool mutually
          constitute each other.

          Furthermore, communications sciences and modern biolo- gies are
          constructed by a common move—the translation of the world into a
          problem of coding, a search for a common language in which all
          resistance to instrumental control disappears and all heterogeneity
          can be submitted to disassembly, reassembly, investment, and exchange.
          In communications sciences, the translation of the world into a
          problem in coding can be illustrated by looking at cyber- netic
          (feedback-controlled) systems theories applied to tele- phone
          technology, computer design, weapons deployment, or database
          construction and maintenance. In each case, solution to the key
          questions rests on a theory of language and control; the key operation
          is determining the rates, directions, and prob- abilities of flow of a
          quantity called information. The world is subdivided by boundaries
          differentially permeable to informa- tion. Information is just that
          kind of quantifiable element (unit, basis of unity) that allows
          universal translation, and so unhin- dered instrumental power (called
          effective communication). The biggest threat to such power is
          interruption of communi- cation. Any system breakdown is a function of
          stress. The fun- damentals of this technology can be condensed into
          the meta - phor C3I, command-control-communication-intelligence, the
          military’s symbol for its operations theory. In modern biologies, the
          translation of the world into a prob- lem in coding can be illustrated
          by molecular genetics, ecology, sociobiological evolutionary theory,
          and immunobiology. The organism has been translated into problems of
          genetic coding and readout. Biotechnology, a writing technology,
          informs re- search broadly.18 In a sense, organisms have ceased to
          exist as objects of knowledge, giving way to biotic components, i.e.,
          special kinds of information-processing devices. The analogous moves
          in ecology could be examined by probing the history and utility of the
          concept of the ecosystem. Immunobiology and as- sociated medical
          practices are rich exemplars of the privilege of coding and
          recognition systems as objects of knowledge, as con- structions of
          bodily reality for us. Biology here is a kind of cryp- tography.
          Research is necessarily a kind of intelligence activity. Ironies
          abound. A stressed system goes awry; its communica- tion processes
          break down; it fails to recognize the difference be- tween self and
          other. Human babies with baboon hearts evoke national ethical
          perplexity—for animal rights activists at least as much as for the
          guardians of human purity. In the United States gay men and
          intravenous drug users are the “privileged” victims of an awful immune
          system disease that marks (in- scribes on the body) confusion of
          boundaries and moral pollu- tion (Treichler 1987). But these
          excursions into communications sciences and bi- ology have been at a
          rarefied level; there is a mundane, largely economic reality to
          support my claim that these sciences and technologies indicate
          fundamental transformations in the structure of the world for us.
          Communications technologies de- pend on electronics. Modern states,
          multinational corporations, military power, welfare state apparatuses,
          satellite systems, political processes, fabrication of our
          imaginations, labor-con- trol systems, medical constructions of our
          bodies, commercial pornography, the international division of labor,
          and religious evangelism depend intimately on electronics.
          Microelectronics is the technical basis of simulacra—that is, of
          copies without originals. Microelectronics mediates the translations
          of labor into ro- botics and word processing, sex into genetic
          engineering and reproductive technologies, and mind into artificial
          intelligence and decision procedures. The new biotechnologies concern
          more than human reproduction. Biology as a powerful engi- neering
          science for redesigning materials and processes has revolutionary
          implications for industry, perhaps most obvious today in areas of
          fermentation, agriculture, and energy. Com- munications sciences and
          biology are constructions of natural- technical objects of knowledge
          in which the difference between machine and organism is thoroughly
          blurred; mind, body, and tool are on very intimate terms. The
          “multinational” material organization of the production and
          reproduction of daily life and the symbolic organization of the
          production and repro - duction of culture and imagination seem equally
          implicated. The boundary-maintaining images of base and
          superstructure, public and private, or material and ideal never seemed
          more feeble. I have used Rachel Grossman’s (1980) image of women in
          the integrated circuit to name the situation of women in a world so
          intimately restructured through the social relations of science and
          technology.19 I used the odd circumlocution the social rela- tions of
          science and technology to indicate that we are not deal- ing with a
          technological determinism, but with a historical sys- tem depending on
          structured relations among people. But the phrase should also indicate
          that science and technology provide fresh sources of power, that we
          need fresh sources of analysis and political action (Latour 1984).
          Some of the rearrangements of race, sex, and class rooted in
          high-tech–facilitated social re- lations can make socialist-feminism
          more relevant to effective progressive politics.
