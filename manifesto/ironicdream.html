        This essay is an efort to build an ironic political myth faithful to
        feminism, socialism, and materialism. Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy
        is faithful, than as reverent worship and identifcation. Blasphemy has
        always seemed to require taking things very seriously. I know no better
        stance to adopt from within the secular-religious, evangelical
        traditions of United States politics, including the politics of
        socialist-feminism. Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority
        within, while still insisting on the need for community. Blasphemy is
        not apostasy. Irony is about contradictions that do not resolve into
        larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension of holding
        incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true.
        Irony is about humor and serious play. It is also a rhetorical strategy
        and a political method, one I would like to see more honored within
        socialist-feminism. At the center of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is
        the image of the cyborg.
