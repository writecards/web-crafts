    <h1>MEDIATIONS - shengli wen</h1>

    <p>
      Mediations is a lexicon of vocabularies, artworks, and movements that
      respond to shared and diverging experiences among the asian queer/trans
      diaspora. It uses Notion API as a CMS and was created with ViteJS, Open
      Props, HTML, and CSS. It’s hosted with Netlify’s serverless function.
    </p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      The name stems from how histories of both Asian bodies and queer/trans
      bodies have been mediated, as these communities haven’t always had agency
      in how their stories are told. The site is evolving in tandem with a
      series of physical gatherings exploring themes such as queerness,
      diaspora, racial and cultural identities, lineage, and temporality. This
      project views the webpage as a form of collaborative time-based media, a
      space to gather thoughts and ideas, a space that allows for change and
      growth over time along with the futures we imagine.
    </p>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
      Mindy Seu’s cyberfeminism index serves as a huge source of inspiration, as
      well as Xin Wang’s Asian futurism archive on Tumblr. Laurel Schwulst is
      also a major influence in terms of visual aesthetic.
    </p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      While getting the Notion SDK to work with Netlify was a huge challenge,
      I’m very glad it works. Future improvements include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the about page works locally but does not work on netlify, need to debug
      </li>
      <li>
        the styling (paddings, alignments, etc) and font choice needs further
        adjustment
      </li>

      <li>add night mode</li>
      <li>improve responsiveness</li>
      <li>
        add a front-end interface for user submissions (and think about how to
        moderate?)
      </li>
    </ul>
