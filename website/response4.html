        American Artist’s Black Gooey Universe is a clever play on words that
        explores how technology exploits Blackness. American Artist writes
        "Racial Slavery -- which generated Blackness as a site of permanent
        extraction, gratuitous physical violence, and social death -- provided
        the material and ideological basis for the United States.
        Unsurprisingly, Silicon Valley advances this constitutive anti-blackness
        through its technological products and processes.” “Mother of all Demos
        II” is extremely powerful in the way that it forces viewers to think
        about how the Black workforce has historically been the least
        represented minority group in Silicon Valley. When trying to research
        background on American Artist, I found out he doesn’t have much public
        information, and this is an intentional decision, which speaks directly
        to how Black lives have been forgotten across fields of art, design,
        tech, etc. I found his pieces very compelling. His work is truly
        brilliant.
