        In the introduction, Galloway notes that with a stroke of a delete key,
        a whole country could be swept off the internet (9). This made me
        curious about how internet censorship works in mainland China. According
        to wikipedia (take this with a grain of salt), the government blocks
        website content and internet access - and major internet platforms in
        China established elaborate self-censorship mechanisms. “Methods used to
        block websites and pages include [DNS
        spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing), blocking access
        to [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address), analyzing
        and filtering [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL), packet
        inspection, and resetting
        connections.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_China#cite_note-howto-3)”
        here’s a simplified topology of the chinese firewall
        [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Topology_of_the_Chinese_firewall.svg/1200px-Topology_of_the_Chinese_firewall.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Topology_of_the_Chinese_firewall.svg/1200px-Topology_of_the_Chinese_firewall.svg.png)

        What’s interesting to me is the dynamic aspect of China’s censorship
        policies. Earlier this year when Russia first invaded Ukraine, to combat
        disinformation, several Chinese social platforms announced that they
        will display user locations based on IP addresses, which display the
        user’s province or region. Google was banned in China in 2002. A mirror
        website elgooG was created by All Too Flat, which was initially made for
        fun but had practical use for people in China. I grew up as an expat in
        Lanzhou China. I remember my family having a VPN where we could pick
        different locations to access the internet from (perhaps we were
        actually changing our IP address?). My memory of this is hazy but I do
        recall youtube being censored off and on. Chinese internet users’
        evasion of internet censorship is also ridiculously amazing. A common
        way is to use analogies to discuss topics. Evasion is a form of internet
        activism.
