        Shoshana Zuboff is an American author and professor at Harvard
        University. She defines surveillance capitalism as “as the unilateral
        claiming of private human experience as free raw material for
        translation into behavioral data. These data are then computed and
        packaged as prediction products and sold into behavioral futures markets
        — business customers with a commercial interest in knowing what we will
        do now, soon, and later.” A key distinction about surveillance
        capitalism, is that the emphasis is on user’s behavioral data — google
        started mining how users type in the search bar for instance
        (capitalization, typos, etc) to predict the users emotions or needs.
        What’s alarming to me is how successful these companies are, as we are
        inherently used to a level of surveillance on the internet. Getting
        targeted ads on social media is something I’m sure a lot of us are
        accustomed to. I can’t help thinking about BeReal from a surveillance
        capitalism lens. BeReal, an app that promotes itself as being the most
        authentic social media app by prompting users to take. a photo at a
        random time of day, is actually the jackpot for surveillance capitalist
        corporations, as they can literally see how people are acting and what
        they’re doing at any time of day. It’s quite disturbing :0 Personally,
        maybe I’m cynical or hypocritical — but despite knowing the implications
        of corporate capitalism, I still partake from time to time. I feel
        similarly about surveillance capitalism, I know it’s happening, but feel
        a bit hopeless or complicit as someone whose data is being mined.

        Adding on after the in-class discussion, perhaps it's Zuboff's tone that
        makes me feel this lack of agency. Because actually while I'm aware of
        surveillance capitalism, I think my day to day isn't impacted as much by
        it.
