      <h1>Website for Donna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto" - shengli wen</h1>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Donna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto" was published in 1985. It is about
        rejecting regid boundaries between human/animal/machine. The manifesto
        criticizes traditional gender and feminist norms, and it's cited as a
        major influence in the femist posthuman circles.
      </p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>
        Donna Haraway's work on ecology has been incredibly inspiring. I wanted
        to take this assignment as an opportunity to dive into her Cyborg
        Manifesto. I must admit, it was a really difficult and dense text for me
        to process. This influenced how I decided to present the text on the
        screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started by creating a home page with five sections, mirroring the
        subsections in the manifsto. I wanted to create an abstract layout for
        the home page, with slow moving css animations to create an ambient
        effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the manifesto is over 60 pages, in the time frame of this class,
        I've only finished coding the first three sections. The first section's
        content is presented in a large textsize with gradient shadow. The user
        can click through the text one sentence at a time. This was intended to
        help viewers digest the text slower.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second section is a series of squares with an image of California's
        San Andreas Faltline in the background. This illudes to a quote I read
        in the cyberfeminism index, which says the manifesto had an earthquake
        effect and jolted academia and cyberculture in general. The text scrolls
        super fast here, mimicing the speed and intensity of the influence of
        this text.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third section all on one page, with alternating blurriness on each
        sentence. This again was intended to create visual emphasis on each
        sentence as the viewer browses through.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Section 4: to be completed. the goal is to use rita.js and swap out
        words with similar ones)
      </p>
      <p>
        (Section 5: to be completed. the goal is to present the text on a 3d
        plane on faces of cubes.
      </p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        What started as a daunting task morphed into an exploration on the
        possibilities of CSS. I hope to finish the rest of the pages over winter
        break, and fix some of the readability and functionality of the current
        pages. I showed this site to my roommate, who said: "I love this but
        find it a little disturbing." I want to lean into this feeling more.
