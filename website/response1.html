      I really appreciate Laurel Schwulst’s thoughts on internet/social
      media/and the personal webpage in a contemporary context. I see a lot of
      my own feelings echoed in her words. For one, Schwulst mentions the
      “technological frictions and social pressures” that come with creating and
      maintaining a website in 2018, which is unfortunately so true in an era
      where social media’s goal from the corporate perspective is ultimately to
      make profit off of our attention and bodies. I also find her statement on
      the website’s potential to be a self-reflexive loop to be quite
      interesting - “when you put energy into a website, in turn the website
      helps form your own identity.” As an ‘artist’ who is wrapping up
      undergrad, I resonate with this on a personal level as I’ve struggled with
      the “About Me” section on my portfolio - as the thought of defining myself
      in a few sentences has always been rather anxiety inducing. I’ve recently
      shifted my perspective to treat myself and my website with more kindness,
      accepting that whatever I write now can be updated later (similar to her
      ‘website as garden’ metaphor). A mutual friend named Tiger Dingsun is a
      web developer and graphic designer who works with text. His undergrad
      thesis, which I find relevant to this week’s theme, was a series of 18
      websites that demonstrate various ways of re-imagining what
      reading/presenting text can look like and examining the webpage as a form
      of time-based media. He actually interviewed Laurel Schwulst during his
      design process, on her thoughts generating text (what a coincidence!). His
      (amazing) thesis is here:
